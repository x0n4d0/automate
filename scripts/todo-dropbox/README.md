Todo

</h1>

This script I use all the time. I always leave a file in my Dropbox called TODO.txt, in this file I make several notes and I prefer to annotate in txt even than using some personal management site.

So I made this one line script and turned it into linux command. I simply open the terminal via the shortcut `Ctrl + Alt + T` and write it `todo`. Like:
```sh
$ todo
```
Then the exact file opens to make my notes. For clarification only, `todo` is 'To Do'.
